Web app with NASA's API integration that shows a different picture and an explanation every day.

**Link to project:** http://https://astronomyclub.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I used javascript to make a request to the NASA API to gather data including explanations and pictures taken from space and I created the front end app that shows the data to the user when select a date. 

## Optimizations
Adding more API'S by NASA so the users can check other interesting data such as images from Mars.

## Lessons Learned:
Connecting, making requests to public API'S and designing the front end that interacts with the data to display it in a user friendly way.
